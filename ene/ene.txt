Solution:

given (AB) and (A+B), where A is image data and B is key, xor files:

(AB) x (A+B)
(AB)~(A+B) + ~(AB)(A+B)
AB~A~B + (~A + ~B)(A+B)
~AA + ~BA + ~AB + ~BB
~BA + ~AB
AxB

the result is the image data xored with the key

using known header data for image, key can be determined:

BA 8B A0 23 F1 77 65 48 EB B1 7A C9 45 C4 2F DE

xor key with rest of image to get flag:
